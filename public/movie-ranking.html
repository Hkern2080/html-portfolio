<h1>Definitive Star Wars Trilogy Movie Ranking</h1>
<h2>Star Wars Movies Ranked from Best to Worst.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>The Best Star Wars of all time, there is no discussion or debate</p>
<h3>2. A New Hope</h3>
<p>The movie that started it all.</p>
<h3>3. Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>Anakin falls as do the Jedi, culminating in the epic battle between Master and Student.</p>
<h3>4. Return of The Jedi</h3>
<p>The Empire falls and Vader is redeemed, what's not to love.</p>
<h3>5. Attack of the clones</h3>
<p>Dooku puts an arrogant kid in his place and Yoda shows why he is the man.</p>
<h3>6. The Force Awakens</h3>
<p>Enjoyable movie but the Mary Sue plotline and lack of sensible character developement hurts what could have been a great film.</p>
<h3>7. The Rise of Skywalker</h3>
<p>Sorry Disney, Your colors are showing.</p>
<h3>8. The Phantom Menace</h3>
<p>We waited 16 years for this disappointment, well, at least Darth Maul was kinda cool.</p>
<h3>9. The Last Jedi</h3>
<p>Luke's character assassination hurt me in my soul. Snoke was a huge missed opportunity, Kylo shows himself to be much more like the bratty teen version of Anakin than the Fearsome Darth Vader he idolizes, and find a way to show Leia's power without turning her into Mary Poppins.</p>
